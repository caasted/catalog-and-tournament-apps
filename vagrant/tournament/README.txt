tournament.sql contains the SQL commands to create the two tables required to run the Swiss-style tournament.

tournament.py contains functions to access the tournament tables and determine pairings for each round of the tournament.

Running tournament_test.py will validate that the tournament tables are setup correctly and the tournament.py functions perform the correct operations.

A demonstration of a full Swiss-style tournament can be launched by running tournament_demo.py.
