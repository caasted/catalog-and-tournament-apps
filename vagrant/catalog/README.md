# Catalog App Project

## Instructions
1. Within a running vagrant virtual machine, navigate to `/vagrant/catalog/`.
2. Initialize the supporting database by running `python database_setup.py`.
3. You can populate the database with a sample catalog by running `python database_fill.py`.
4. Run `python project.py` to launch the python webserver.
5. View the web application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000/`.
6. Login through the link in the top-left and connect using your Google+ account.

If you run these steps in order, the sample store will not be editable because you are not the owner.
If you complete steps 4-6 before step 3, you will then be the owner of the store.
